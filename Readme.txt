Monster Hunter: World - DualShock 4 Controller Prompts v1.0
Mod by MHVuze

Tested and working with game build 151639.

Use at your own risk! Play in offline mode if you fear a ban or whatever.

How-to:
1. Move the nativePC folder from the downloaded archive to your install dir (i.e. D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World)
2. Profit

If the controller detection is fixed in an upcoming patch or you want to get rid of it for some other reason, just remove the nativePC folder.
If you have other mods installed, remove the two files of this mod to keep the other mods intact.

If you downloaded this mod from anywhere but NexusMods or the release post linked below, be wary of malicious modifications.
